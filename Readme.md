# caesar-cipher
this is a Encrypted/Decrypted text convert simple text and caesar cipher 
Abstract:
This encryption/decryption method is one of the oldest and was used by Roman dictator Julius Caesar to provide cryptic orders to his army. Despite the fact that many new algorithms have been developed, the cypher algorithm remains secure and fast due to its simplicity.

Aim of the Project:  To understand encryption and decryption using Caesar Cipher.

#How does it work?

This algorithm follows the simple logic of numeric cipher i.e. the numeric values or alphabetic values are shifted to the right by many times.

USAGE

To use the Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository or download the source code.

2.Open the index.html file in a web browser.

3.Select the desired operation from the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" radio button.

4.Enter the desired shift value, which determines how many positions each letter will be shifted.

5.Enter the desired modulo value, which determines the length of the alphabet.

6.Select the letter case you want maintaincase, lowercase, and uppercase.

7.Select the foreign key you want to ignore or remove, if you selected to remove it will remove symbols.

8.Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input field provided.

9.Click the submit button.

10.The result will be displayed in the output section.

#EXAMPLE:-

Encryption If you want to encrypt the message "Rakesh" with  the resulting ciphertext will be "Udnhvk"
